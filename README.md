# Anomalydetection
Custom library for anomaly detection using Isolation forests. Explainabity done using the SHAP library.

The code used to make the library is not shared here because it is being used commercially. 
However, I have imported the library built from my local system and obtained the necessary results which are displayed alongwith the notebooks.
Feel free to get in touch if you want a look at the library's code, I'm willing to present it remotely.
